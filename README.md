# Linear-Regression-Example

## 1. Problem
National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a mobile phone application and a website to enable citizens to make appointments and pay fees for vaccines, especially COVID vaccines, as well as other vaccines such as hepatitis B and meningitis. We want to decide which of these two platforms should be further developed to better reach citizens.

We will use the NIH_Customers.csv data:

 * Avg. Session Length: Average session length of in-person sessions in the hospital.
 * Time on App: Average time spent on the App (in minutes).
 * Time on Website: Average time spent on the Website (in minutes).
 * Yearly social security fee: The amount each patient pays yearly.

## Steps

The steps to be followed in this example are as follows:

1. **Importing the Required Libraries**  
   Loading and importing all the libraries to be used in the project.

2. **Exploring the Data**  
   Reviewing the basic characteristics and structure of the dataset.

3. **Visualizing the Data and Examining Correlations**  
   Visualizing key features in the data with graphs and analyzing correlations between variables.

4. **Creating Train/Test Data**  
   Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Training the Model**  
   Training the selected machine learning model with the training data.

6. **Making Predictions with Test Data**  
   Making predictions on the test set using the trained model.

7. **Evaluating the Model**  
   Assessing the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.

8. **Examining the Distribution of Residuals**  
   Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of the model’s prediction errors (residuals).

9. **Interpreting the Results**  
   Interpreting the results obtained and evaluating the outcomes.
